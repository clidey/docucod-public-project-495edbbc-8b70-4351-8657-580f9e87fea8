# Automating Python Unit Test Generation

## Workflow Overview

### Task Description
This guide walks you through the process of using the Python Testing Tools MCP Server's unit test generator to automatically create comprehensive and well-structured unit test suites for your Python codebases. It focuses specifically on generating tests by analyzing your source functions and harnessing AI-powered capabilities to cover normal cases, edge cases, and exception handling scenarios.

### Prerequisites
- You have the Python Testing Tools MCP Server installed and running.
- The `baml` Python package is installed (`pip install baml`).
- Familiarity with basic Python testing using the `unittest` framework.
- Access to your Python source file(s) requiring unit tests.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will generate a fully formed unittest test file for each Python module you target. Each test suite:
- Contains multiple test cases per function (4-6 by default).
- Covers positive, edge, and error scenarios.
- Uses proper `self.assertRaises()` context for exceptions.
- Has appropriate imports and follows conventions for test class names.

This process drastically reduces manual test writing effort while ensuring your code is reliably validated.

### Time Estimate
Depending on the size and complexity of your source file, test generation typically completes within a few seconds to a couple of minutes.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate. No deep AI knowledge or complex setup is required, but familiarity with Python unittest structure is beneficial.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Python Source File
Ensure your Python file contains well-formed function definitions you want to test.

### Step 2: Execute the Unit Test Generator
Use the provided utility function `generate_unit_tests` from the `tools.unit_test_generator` module.

```python
from tools.unit_test_generator import generate_unit_tests

result_message = generate_unit_tests('path/to/your_file.py')
print(result_message)
```

**Outcome**: The tool parses your source functions, submits them to the AI-powered BAML client, and produces a new test file `test_your_file.py` in the same directory.

### Step 3: Understand the Generated Test File
Open the generated `test_your_file.py` file. It includes:
- Appropriate imports, including your original module.
- A test class named `TestYourFile` matching your module name.
- Multiple test methods per function, each named with the `test_` prefix.
- Properly indented test bodies with assertions and error handling blocks.

### Step 4: Review and Run the Tests
Run your test suite using:

```bash
python -m unittest test_your_file.py
```

Verify all tests pass and cover the expected scenarios.

### Step 5: Iterate and Refine
If needed, you can run the generator again after updating your source code to regenerate tests.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

- **Function Extraction**: The generator automatically detects all top-level functions. For methods inside classes, add them manually or extend tooling.
- **Test Naming**: The tool ensures test method names begin with `test_`. If AI-generated names lack this, it prefixes automatically.
- **Indentation Handling**: The generator smartly preserves indentation, especially within `self.assertRaises` context blocks.
- **Module Prefixing**: Calls inside test bodies that match source functions are automatically prefixed with the module name to avoid namespace errors.
- **Error Handling**: If AI generation fails for any function, a placeholder test is created with a TODO comment.

## Example Usage and Generated Output

### Example Source Function
```python
# demo/basic_example_functions.py

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError('division by zero')
    return a / b
```

### Sample Generated Test Snippet
```python
import unittest
import basic_example_functions

class TestBasicExampleFunctions(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(basic_example_functions.add(2, 3), 5)

    def test_add_with_zero(self):
        self.assertEqual(basic_example_functions.add(0, 5), 5)

    def test_divide_normal_case(self):
        self.assertEqual(basic_example_functions.divide(10, 2), 5)

    def test_divide_by_zero_raises(self):
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            basic_example_functions.divide(10, 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## Troubleshooting & Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Common Issues and Resolutions">
<Accordion title="No Functions Found to Generate Tests">
- Ensure your source file contains syntactically correct Python function definitions.
- Check for correct file path and permissions.
- Confirm the file is not empty.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="AI Generation Failure for Specific Functions">
- The tool falls back to placeholder tests with TODO comments.
- Review the error message in the placeholder comment for clues.
- Simplify or refactor complex functions and retry.
- Make sure environment variables like `GEMINI_API_KEY` are set correctly.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Indentation or Import Errors in Generated Tests">
- The generator attempts intelligent indentation, but manual tweaks may be needed in rare cases.
- Verify you have the same module name as in your source path.
- Check for circular imports or name collisions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Always run `unittest` or your chosen test runner on generated files before integrating them into CI pipelines to catch edge case issues early.
