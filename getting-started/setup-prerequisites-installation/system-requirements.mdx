# System Requirements & Prerequisites

Before diving into installing and running the Python Testing Tools MCP Server, ensuring your environment meets the essential system requirements and prerequisites is critical. This preparation guarantees a smooth installation process and optimal performance of the MCP server's AI-powered testing capabilities.

---

## 1. Supported Operating Systems

The Python Testing Tools MCP Server is designed to run on modern, widely used operating systems:

- **Linux** (Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian, CentOS) — Recommended for production use
- **macOS** (Catalina 10.15+)
- **Windows 10+** (with WSL2 recommended for Unix-like environment compatibility)

Ensure your system is fully updated to avoid compatibility issues during installation.

---

## 2. Python Version Compatibility

To run the MCP server and its underlying utilities correctly:

- **Python 3.10 or later** is required.
- The server leverages new language features and typing improvements present in Python 3.10+.

Verify your Python version with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If required, install or upgrade Python following official guides for your OS.

---

## 3. Environment Requirements

### Virtual Environment (Strongly Recommended)

Create a dedicated virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv mcp_env
source mcp_env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
mcp_env\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

### Disk Space & Memory

- Ensure **at least 500MB free disk space** for installation and cache.
- Recommended RAM: **4GB minimum**, 8GB+ for smoother AI model operations.

### Dependency Management

The server uses `uv` (Universal Virtualization) for dependency management. It will handle installing all Python packages listed in `pyproject.toml`.

Run:

```bash
uv sync
```

This command creates a virtual environment (if needed) and installs the core dependencies, including:

- `fastmcp` (MCP server framework)
- `baml` and `baml-cli` (for AI prompt generation and parsing)
- Google Gemini AI client
- `coverage.py` (for built-in code coverage reporting)

---

## 4. External Account Requirements

To leverage the **Google Gemini AI** services integrated within the MCP server, you must have the following:

### Google Gemini API Access

- **Google Cloud Account** with permissions to access Gemini AI models.
- Obtain a valid **GEMINI_API_KEY** with the necessary scopes to invoke AI services.

### Setting Up Gemini API Key

Export your Gemini API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-gemini-api-key"
```

On Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your-google-gemini-api-key"
```

You can also define this key permanently in environment configuration files or pass it along in container/CLI execution environments.

### Optional Model Selection

By default, the MCP server uses the `gemini-2.5-flash` AI model. You can specify a different model by setting:

```bash
export GEMINI_MODEL="desired-model-name"
```

If unset, the default model will be used.

---

## 5. Network & Connectivity Requirements

- Ensure your machine has **outbound internet access** to communicate with Google Gemini API endpoints.
- Verify firewall settings allow HTTPS traffic (port 443) outbound.
- If running behind a proxy, configure your environment variables (e.g., `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`) accordingly.

## 6. Key Environment Variables Summary

| Variable Name   | Purpose                                  | Required / Optional | Default Value       |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY`| Your Google Gemini API access key        | Required            | None                |
| `GEMINI_MODEL`  | AI model to use for test generation       | Optional            | `gemini-2.5-flash`  |

---

## 7. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Always validate your `GEMINI_API_KEY` before starting the server.** 
- Avoid running the server with Python versions below 3.10 to prevent compatibility errors.
- Use a virtual environment to prevent package conflicts.
- Confirm all dependencies are installed with `uv sync` before proceeding.
- Set environment variables early to avoid runtime configuration issues.

---

## 8. Verification Checklist Before Installation

Use this checklist to confirm your environment readiness:

- [ ] Running a supported OS (Linux, macOS, Windows with WSL2)
- [ ] Python 3.10 or later installed and accessible
- [ ] Virtual environment created and activated
- [ ] Dependencies installed via `uv sync` successfully
- [ ] `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable set and valid
- [ ] Network access to Google Gemini APIs verified

Once these are met, proceed to the installation steps in the [Installation Steps Guide](../setup-prerequisites-installation/installation-steps).
