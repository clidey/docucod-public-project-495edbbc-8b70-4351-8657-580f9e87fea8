# Installation Steps for Python Testing Tools MCP Server

Welcome to the installation guide for the Python Testing Tools MCP Server. This page delivers clear, step-by-step instructions to get the MCP server installed and running on your machine, including setting up dependencies, virtual environments, and required libraries. By following this guide, you'll ensure a smooth installation to start leveraging AI-powered Python test automation.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin installation, ensure your environment meets the following prerequisites:

- **Python Version:** Use Python 3.12 as specified in the `.python-version` file.
- **Operating System Compatibility:** Compatible with common OSes supporting Python 3.12 (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- **Python Package Manager:** `pip` package manager must be available.
- **UV Tool:** You'll use the `uv` tool to handle virtual environments and dependencies as configured via `pyproject.toml`.
- **Environment Variables:** You'll need to set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable (your Google Gemini API key).

<Tip>
Setting your API key beforehand is critical to allow the MCP server to utilize Google's Gemini AI services during operation.
</Tip>

## 2. Setup Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies

The recommended approach to install MCP server dependencies and isolate your environment is via the `uv` tool, which ensures reproducible environments using the provided `pyproject.toml`.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository (if not done already)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jazzberry-ai/python-testing-mcp.git
cd python-testing-mcp
```

### Step 2: Synchronize and Install Dependencies

This command creates a controlled virtual environment and installs all required packages automatically, including the FastMCP framework, BAML client, Gemini AI client, and testing utilities:

```bash
uv sync
```

Expected Output:
- Creation of a virtual environment (if not present)
- Installation of packages like `fastmcp`, `baml`, `google-generativeai`, `coverage`, and others defined in `pyproject.toml`

<Check>
If any error occurs here, verify your Python version is 3.12 and that you have network connectivity to PyPI.
</Check>

---

## 3. Install BAML Python Client

The MCP server depends on the Boundary ML (BAML) client library for structured AI-based test generation.

Run:

```bash
pip install baml
```

This ensures the BAML client and `baml-cli` command line tools are installed for AI integration.

---

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

Set the Google Gemini API key environment variable for AI model access:

- On macOS/Linux:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

- On Windows (Powershell):

```powershell
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"
```

<Tip>
Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Google Gemini API key.
</Tip>

Optionally, specify a Gemini model (default is `gemini-2.5-flash`):

```bash
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"
```

---

## 5. Optional: Verify Python Version

Ensure your environment uses Python 3.12 before running the server:

```bash
python --version
# Should return Python 3.12.x
```

If it does not, configure your environment accordingly.

---

## 6. Run the MCP Server

Once dependencies and environment variables are set, start the MCP server:

```bash
uv run python python_testing_mcp_server.py
```

You should see terminal messages indicating the server is running and ready to accept test requests.

<Note>
This command runs the FastMCP server defined in `python_testing_mcp_server.py` which exposes the AI-based Python testing tools.
</Note>

---

## 7. Verification & Next Steps

To verify a successful installation and get acquainted with the tools:

- Use the demo files in the `demo/` directory for initial test generations.
- Refer to [Starting the Server](/getting-started/first-run-usage-validation/starting-the-server) to confirm server readiness.
- Follow the [Quick Validation & First Test Run](/getting-started/first-run-usage-validation/first-successful-validation) guide to run your first test operation.

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">

<Accordion title="Dependency Installation Fails">
If `uv sync` or `pip install baml` fails:
- Verify Python 3.12 is installed and active in your PATH.
- Check for network restrictions or firewall blocking PyPI.
- Try upgrading `pip` with `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GEMINI_API_KEY Not Set or Invalid">
- Confirm environment variable is correctly set for your shell.
- Restart your terminal or IDE to propagate changes.
- Verify your API key is active and valid with Google's Gemini service.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Python Version Mismatch">
- Use pyenv or similar environment manager to install and activate Python 3.12.
- Adjust your IDE/editor interpreter settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Server Fails to Start">
- Check error logs for missing dependencies.
- Ensure environment variables are available in your run context.
- Run in verbose mode if possible to gather more details.
</Accordion>

## 9. Additional Installation Methods

If you are integrating into Claude Code or prefer alternative startup methods, consider:

- **Claude Code MCP Addition:**
  ```
  claude mcp add python_testing_tools --env GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key -- uv run python python_testing_mcp_server.py
  ```
- **FastMCP Direct Install:**
  ```
  uv run fastmcp install python_testing_mcp_server.py --env-var GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
  ```
- **Manual Configuration:** Edit `.claude.json` to register your MCP server with custom environment settings.

Refer to the detailed installation in the README for these options.

# Code Snippets Recap

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jazzberry-ai/python-testing-mcp.git
cd python-testing-mcp
uv sync
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
uv run python python_testing_mcp_server.py
```

---

# Troubleshooting Example
If you see "GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is required" error:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
# Or on Windows Powershell
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your-api-key"
```

Restart your terminal session and try again.

---

# Best Practices
- Always isolate your environment with `uv` to avoid dependency conflicts.
- Keep your API key secure and avoid committing it in source control.
- Use the demo files under `demo/` for guided initial tests.
- Regularly update dependencies with `uv sync` if upgrades occur.
